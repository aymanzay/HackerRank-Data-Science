quora.py; Problem Description:
Quora uses a combination of machine learning (ML) algorithms and moderation to ensure high-quality content on the site. High answer quality has helped Quora distinguish itself from other Q&A sites on the web.  

Your task will be to devise a classifier that is able to tell good answers from bad answers, as well as humans can.  A good answer is denoted by a +1 in our system, and a bad answer is denoted by a -1.

Input Format:

The first line contains N, M. N = Number of training data records, M = number of parameters. Followed by N lines containing records of training data. Then one integer q, q = number of records to be classified, followed by q lines of query data
Training data corresponds to the following format:
(:)*

Query data corresponds to the following format:
(:)*

The answer identifier  is an alphanumeric string of no more than 10 chars.  Each identifier is guaranteed unique.  All feature values are doubles.

The data is extracted from real production data, and thus will not include the raw form of the answers. We, however, have extracted as many features as we think are useful, and you can decide which features make sense to be included in your final algorithm. The actual labelling of a good answer and bad answer is done organically on our site, through both human moderators as well as our own classifier.

Output Format:

For each query, you should output q lines to stdout, representing the decision made by your classifier, whether each answer is good or not:

stocks.py; Problem Description

A time series of a stock's highest price during a trading day (at the New York Stock Exchange), is provided to you. In each test case, the day's highest prices is missing for certain days. By analyzing the data, try to identify the missing price for those particular days.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer N, which is the number of rows of data to follow. 
This is followed by N rows of data, each of which contains a time-stamp in the first column and the day's highest price for the stock in the second column. There is a tab delimiter between the two columns of data. 
There are exactly twenty rows in each input file, where the day's highest price is missing. The missing prices are marked as "Missing_1", "Missing_2" .."Missing_20". These missing records have been randomly dispersed in the rows of data.

Output Format 
The output should contain exactly twenty rows, each containg your predicted value, for each of the missing values (Missing_1, Missing_2 ... Missing_20) in that order.

grades.py;

This challenge is based on real school data of the CBSE Class 12 examination conducted in the year 2013. You are given the grades obtained by students with specific but popular combinations of subjects (and all these students had opted for Mathematics). Their grades in four subjects are known to you. However their grade in Mathematics (i.e, the fifth subject) is hidden.

The records provided to you are the grades obtained by students who had opted for the following combinations of subjects or courses and obtained a passing grade in each subject. The individual subjects in the data are: 
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, Biology, Physical Education, Economics, Accountancy and Business Studies.

The most dominant subject combinations, account for approximately 99% of the data are:

English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science    
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Physical Education    
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Economics    
English, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology  
English, Economics, Accountancy, Mathematics, Business Studies   

Input Format

The first line will be an integer N. N lines follow each line being a valid JSON object. The following fields of raw data are given in json.

SerialNumber (Numeric): The identifier of the student record. This is provided just for identification purposes and does not have any direct use.  
English (numeric) : The grade (between 1 and 8) obtained in English. This will always be present.  
Three more numeric fields from among: Physics, Chemistry, ComputerScience, Hindi, Biology, PhysicalEducation, Economics, Accountancy, BusinessStudies.  
The input for each record has the grade for all subjects opted by a student, other than Mathematics which you have to predict as the answer.

Output Format

For each student record that is given as a JSON object, containing the grade obtained in four subjects, output the predicted grade in Mathematics (this will be a numeral between 1 and 8, both inclusive) in a newline.
